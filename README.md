# Basic Sample Collectible Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Collectible Hardhat use case (NFT). It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
Recommend in order to run ./scripts/proccess-nft.js you need to prepare 4 accounts on rinkeby testnet in the case and the minimum balance of each account is 0.1 ETH. 
I had wrote the script to test the process.
Happy coding!
